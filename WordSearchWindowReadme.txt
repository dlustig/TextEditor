The uploaded class "Search Window" is a free-standing class meant to link up to a window containing a text document containing a JTextComponent. When one desires to make a search window, merely invoke the class's constructor. This constructor takes two arguments, the window it is associated with (such as a JFrame) and the text component it is responsible for searching (such as a JTextArea or JTextField). Everything else is handled by the class. In its current state, there may be more than 1 search window open at the same time. This can be changed if needed. Additionally, I am unsure as whether the SearchWindow will refocus a scroll-pane so that it displays the highlighted text. That may also need to be changed.
The edit list works in a similar fashion. Construct one while passing in the JTextComponent as an arguemnt. You can then use the canUndo(), canRedo(), undo() and redo() methods. Invalid calls to undo and redo will theoretically do nothing if there are no changes to be undone/redone.
